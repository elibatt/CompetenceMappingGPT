  abstract    = {The need to manage, map and develop a companies employees competences is constantly increasing in today’s rapidly growing market. It is therefore incredibly importantto have a broad understanding of what competences one’s employees possess and whichcompetences the company potentially lacks. This thesis investigates how to assess, evaluate and map employees competences in the best possible manner, followed by the potential effects this can have on the individuals undergoing the assessment. Lastly the thesis identifies how a competency management system could be implemented and whichfunctionalities said system should contain. This study began with a systematic literaturereview, for me to get a better understanding of the competency concept and competency assessment. The literature study was followed by a questionnaire distributed to all Etteplansemployees in Linköping and Norrköping, and lastly four interviews were conducted withemployees at the office in Linköping. To get a clearer understanding of the employeesthoughts regarding competency and the implementation of a new competency management system. One of the most important factors to take into consideration when applyinga competency management procedure is that these implementations takes time and mustbe carefully planned and executed to generate the best possible results. All companies areunique and require their own competency management procedure to succeed. },

  abstract = {From the management development viewpoint, it is important to know whether managers possess the required competences to achieve successful job performance. This could be identified by exploring the competency needs. The aim of the paper is to present and discuss results of an empirical investigation on managerial competency needs using quantitative methodology. The study is confined to a fully integrated telecommunication service provider; 198 managerial employees participated in the survey. The findings led to identification of: perceived levels of current competency expertise; current and future competency gaps; and competences that managers wish to improve. Managerial implications, limitations and directions for future research are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},
