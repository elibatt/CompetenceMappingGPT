It is ran by a Milwaukee management company who does not keep the building clean i.e. hallways, basement, exterior of the building, etc. Prior to the new owner purchasing the building, I lived there for 8 years, and within those 8 years my apartment had not been painted, now carpet cleaned/replaced; mold in the bathroom around the tub; closet doors falling off; etc. The basement is a fire hazard as there is nothing by garbage in all of the basement storage spaces which has been down there for years. Most of the garbage that is down there was left behind by tenants who have been gone over 5 years. Each time they rent out an apartment the storage lockers in the basement are never cleaned out for the new tenants to use. The building is supposed to be secure but every door in the basement of all of the buildings are never locked and I never had a key to the basement in the 8 years that i lived there. The carpet is so filthy as it has not been replaced in 8 years. I have gotten it cleaned out of my own pockets 3-4 times but it should be replaced due to normal wear and tear. The only time the carpet is cleaned or replaced in an apartment is when they are renting one out and once the tenant moves in, nothing else is done to their apartment. There are rats in the basement; they have 1 washer and 1 dryer for 16 tenants on each side of the building. Specifically 9060 N. 85th St. All of the hallways look and smell horrible.

I have already had no heating for 1 month (I filed a complaint for that one), and now our refrigerator doesn't work and all of our food is spoiling. The company (Ogden) has basically ghosted me and will not reply to any emails or return phone calls. I truly have no way to reach them since their offices are closed due to COVID and calling them is completely useless (nobody ever picks up after being transferred by the receptionist, nor do they return phone calls). It has been impossible to reach the building manager as well, and their 24 hr emergency line that is supposed to take care of fixing things or outsourced and they have NO RECORD of this company. The two times I've called they have been unable to locate Ogden in their system, which results in nothing being done. Below you will find my first complaint...

I live in apartment 24. Moved in on January 30th. Heat went out in the first days of February, rental company has not acknowledged or answered 4 different emails I have sent asking about fixing the heat. It has been brutally cold in the apartment (I have proof of windows and door frames freezing over). 3 different people have come to look at the radiator, no fix has been issued and the company keeps ignoring my emails. I am not the only tenant with a problem from what I've heard, but maybe the others have not complained. The rental company (Ogden RE) basically gave us two mini heaters that frankly do nothing and expect us to just keep living like this. Their contact information is: (414)276-5285.
