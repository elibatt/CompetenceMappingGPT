The customer called me and mentioned that they are still experiencing disconnections. Upon remote inspection, I found the reported issue. I agreed with the customer on scheduling a field technician for tomorrow.

The field technician performed work in the morning at the cabinet, and the problem seems to have been resolved. I contacted the customer, who informed me that there have been no connection drops since 09:00 in the morning. Agreed to close the report.
