The customer reports having slow connection only with wifi devices, but upon checking with tools, it seems there is an issue at the central office level. I involve the local technician so they can inspect the external central office.

Following the inspection of the external central office, the local technician informs me that there is no problem detected up to the main telephone socket, indicating that the issue is related to the internal installation. I contact the customer and agree on the replacement of the router.

The customer has received the router and connected it. They attempt a browsing test and report that it is working correctly. I ask them to monitor it and contact us in case of any issues. The closure of the report is agreed upon.
