The customer reports a malfunction, but I see the router aligned correctly, yet it does not send requests to establish a session. I try restarting the port remotely several times, but the issue persists. I arrange for an external technician to investigate.

The on-site technician reports that there is no issue on the external route. He states that when he connects to the main phone socket, his tool detects alignment.

After escalating the report, my colleagues inform me that the issue lies with the router lacking configuration. I proceed with the router replacement.

The customer receives the router and browses successfully. Closure agreed upon.
