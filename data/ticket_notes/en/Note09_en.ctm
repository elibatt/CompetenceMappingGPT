The local technician reports a problem in the cabinet. After changing the port, the customer's alignment is correct, and they are now able to browse.

I call the customer, who informs me they've been browsing for fifteen minutes. I explain that there was an issue with the external connection, and now everything is okay. The customer expresses gratitude, and we agree to close the ticket.
