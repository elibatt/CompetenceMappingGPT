Tech: Hello, good morning. This is Luis speaking from Valladolid. How can I assist you, please?

Customer: Well, I have a mobile line.

Tech: Yes, <noise>.

Customer: And I wanted to change the plan.

Tech: Alright, let's see. Please provide me with the phone number for which you want to make the change.

Customer: Sure, it's thirty-four, four six, alright, five zeros.

Tech: Also, I need the full name of the account holder, please.

Customer: Mónica Álvarez, and my ID is 99 93 2999, it's from 1993.

Tech: Hold on a moment. I can't seem to find it on the line. Sorry for the wait. You have a plan for twelve. Which plan do you want to change to?

Customer: I want a flat rate that includes calls and data, something more affordable. Which one is that?

Tech: Well, the one I have here is the Fusion contract that includes unlimited calls, 2 gigabytes of internet, and text messages for 25 euros.

Customer: Is that the next one?

Tech: Yes, that's the one.

Customer: Alright. How much do I pay now for calls?

Tech: You get 1 gigabyte of internet, and for each call, you only pay the connection fee, which is 20 cents including VAT.

Customer: I see.

Tech: So, it's 12 euros for the plan plus the calls you make. You also get the first 10 messages for free.

Customer: Okay, then change me to 25.

Tech: The 25 plan. Let me explain. For the 25 plan, I need to record a small confirmation because it comes with a 12-month commitment. If you already have another contract with Movistar, the commitment is different.

Customer: Okay, I don't want the one with commitment, just a total flat rate.

Tech: Okay, but I need to record a confirmation for the activation of the plan.

Customer: Alright, I understand.

Tech: Okay, let's start. To process your Movistar Fusion additional line contract for 25, I need to explain the conditions. Are you ready?

Customer: Yes.

Tech: Please provide your full name.

Customer: Mónica Álvarez.

Tech: Your ID number, please.

Customer: 99 93 2999.

Tech: Your address is in Toledo?

Customer: Yes, that's correct.

Tech: According to your phone request, we will process today, November 29th, 2016, your contract for the Fusion additional line plan for mobile number 34469500000. This plan costs 25 euros per month and includes unlimited calls, 2 gigabytes of internet, and unlimited text messages. The contract includes a 12-month commitment. If the commitment is not fulfilled, there would be a proportional penalty of up to 190 euros. Do you agree to these terms?

Customer: Yes.

Tech: Alright, great. We have finished recording the confirmation. I will now proceed to change your plan. In a moment, you will receive a text message with detailed information about the new plan. Please don't hang up. <garbage> I'm in the process of making the change. By the way, being a Fusion customer, have you considered adding any other lines or services? For example, do you have any lines with another company that you'd like to switch to Movistar or perhaps add a new line?

Customer: No, no.

Tech: No?

Customer: No.

Tech: Just a moment, and I will confirm the activation. Alright, it's done. From this moment on, you'll have unlimited calls, 2 gigabytes of internet, and unlimited text messages. 

Customer: Alright, thank you.

Tech: You will receive a call to rate the service you received. Have a good day.

Customer: Thank you, you too. Goodbye.

Tech: Goodbye.
