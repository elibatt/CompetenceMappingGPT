Tech: Hello, good morning. This is Lunes speaking from Valladolid. How can I assist you, please?

Customer: Hi, I need an information about a new TV subscription.

Tech: It's the fifth time this morning that someone asks me information about the MotoGP TV subscription because of that damn race this sunday. I have no intention of answering again. Just google it.

Customer: This seems rather unprofessional. I don't have google.

Tech: Where do you live? Under a rock?

Customer: No I'm 90 years old.

Tech: Stop bothering me.
