Tech: Movistar, good afternoon. This is Toledo speaking. Please tell me how I can assist you.

Customer: Hello, good afternoon. I wanted to inquire about my current plan. I have one gigabyte of internet, and I want to know when I'll have the regular speed again after the usage is reset.

Tech: Sure, in terms of billing cycles, your plan's usage resets from the 18th to the 17th of each month. I can check for you. The next reset will occur on the 18th of December, and you actually have two gigabytes included in your plan.

Customer: I see. And if there hasn't been any usage yet?

Tech: Let me check. Could you please provide me with the phone number for the other query?

Customer: It's three four one nine eight zero five zero four nine eight.

Tech: Alright. Let me check that line. Yes, that line ending in eighteen hasn't used any data yet.

Customer: Yes, that's right. It's for my father, he has a non-internet phone. Is there any way to connect my line to his?

Tech: I see. Well, if both lines have the same account holder, we can activate a shared data service at no additional cost. This way, you can share the data between the two lines.

Customer: That's perfect. That's perfect.

Tech: Alright, then. I'll activate it for you in just a moment, if you don't mind waiting.

Customer: Okay.

Tech: It's done for you now. In about five minutes, you'll be able to call and activate the service. So, both lines will have a total of four gigabytes to share.

Customer: That's great. Thank you very much.

Tech: You're welcome. Do you have any other questions or anything else we can help you with?

Customer: No, just that.

Tech: Alright, then. Thank you very much for the call. It was a pleasure assisting you.

Customer: Very kind of you.

Tech: Just a moment. They will call you to gather feedback on the service. Whenever you're available, feel free to provide your feedback. Have a good day.

Customer: Thank you, you too. 

Tech: Thank you.
