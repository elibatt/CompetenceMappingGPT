Customer: No, I don't have a landline.

Tech: Got it. So, you only want to set up direct debit for this mobile number, correct?

Customer: Yes, only for this mobile.

Tech: Alright, let's begin the recording for your security. We're going to record the change of payment account that you're requesting. During the recording, I will ask you some questions, and I appreciate your responses. Please tell me your full name.

Customer: Manuel √Ålvarez.

Tech: Confirm your ID number, please.

Customer: 99912999X.

Tech: Are you the owner of the line?

Customer: Yes.

Tech: The change you want to make is to update the bank account that will be debited for your payments, correct?

Customer: Correct.

Tech: Can you provide me with the account number where you authorize the charges to be made?

Customer: Sure. The account number is 23456789876543210.

Tech: Thank you very much. In this case, we will proceed to make the requested change.

Customer: Okay.

Tech: Let me just make the change. Do you have internet at your home because you could have a fixed line and mobile with internet starting at just forty-seven euros?

Customer: My wife has the fixed line.

Tech: Ah, I see. So you already have Fusion with us.

Customer: Yes.

Tech: I'll update the account here. One moment, please.

Customer: Can this change be done online?

Tech: Yes, you could do it online. You can access the Movistar website to make the change. Just one more thing, you have the Movistar Cero contract with us, but some months you pay thirty-four euros. Customers with Fusion can add additional Fusion lines for twenty-five euros per line. These additional lines include unlimited calls, 2 gigabytes of internet, and unlimited texts.

Customer: Alright, we already have that then. How would the phone be?

Tech: Yes, that's right. Your wife has Fusion, so that's why I mentioned the additional lines. You can now use the new bank account for your payments. Please wait a moment while I make the update.

Customer: Could I have a moment to check this change online?

Tech: Sure, you could check this change online. <garbage> Just a moment, and I will confirm the direct debit. Alright, it's done. From now on, your bills will be debited from the new account. The first bill with this change will be in January of the upcoming year.

Customer: Alright, thank you very much.

Tech: You might receive a call to rate the service you received. Have a good day.

Customer: Thank you, you too.

Tech: Thank you.
