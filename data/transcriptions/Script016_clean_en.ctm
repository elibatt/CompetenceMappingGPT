Customer: Hello.

Tech: Good morning, this is MÃ³nica speaking from Santander. How can I assist you?

Customer: A few days ago, I had a Fusion plan with a hundred megabits, and I wanted to upgrade to three hundred.

Tech: Alright, could you please provide me with the phone number?

Customer: The landline.

Tech: Yes, please.

Customer: I'm not sure.

Tech: Please tell me your account number, if you don't mind.

Customer: <garbage> nine nine nine one two nine nine x.

Tech: And your name?

Customer: Manodar.

Tech: Alright, you mentioned you have a Fusion plan with a hundred-megabit fiber that you want to upgrade to three hundred megabits, correct?

Customer: Yes, does this have a cost?

Tech: In this case, no. The upgrade is automatic, and it will change from a hundred to three hundred megabits at no cost or contract extension. Please bear with me.

Customer: Okay.

Tech: I'm making a note. Please stay on the line.

Customer: Alright.

Tech: I apologize. We are processing the request to upgrade from a hundred to three hundred megabits. Currently, you have the Fusion package without television, correct?

Customer: That's right.

Tech: No television, okay. Currently, you have a hundred minutes for mobile calls and two megabytes of mobile data, correct?

Customer: <garbage> Yes, that's correct.

Tech: Alright, it seems that you're on the complete Fusion package, which also includes the Imaginio service, even though you're not interested in television.

Customer: I'm not interested.

Tech: You don't watch television much?

Customer: No.

Tech: Okay, just to confirm, you're not interested in the football or MotoGP channels?

Customer: No.

Tech: Alright, we also have options for series and movies. Any interest in those?

Customer: No, thanks.

Tech: Do you have any mobile lines with another provider other than Movistar?

Customer: No, just the one.

Tech: Would you be interested in adding more mobile lines with us?

Customer: Oh my god please stop asking me if I want to buy stuff.

Tech: Are you really sure you don't want anything else?

Customer: Yes.

Tech: Ok. Let's proceed with your issue. Wait please. Your request has been processed. Do you need anything else?

Customer: Bye.
