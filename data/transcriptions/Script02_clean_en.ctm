Tech: Good morning, my name is Luisa, and I'm here to assist you from Malaga. How can I help you?

Customer: Good morning. Well, I would like to know the terms and conditions we have with you because I want to upgrade two lines. I also want to know the features we have contracted.

Tech: Alright, please provide me with your account number if you would be so kind.

Customer: Yes, it's nine nine nine, two two nine nine nine nine.

Tech: Please tell me your full name.

Customer: If you've refined something... "mes."

Tech: I will access your account to provide you with information. You have our Fusion package. What do you need assistance with?

Customer: How many phones do I have with you?

Tech: With Fusion, there's one, but I would need to access the mobile part since you can have up to four additional lines. Please provide me with the mobile number associated with Fusion.

Customer: Yes, it's three four three, sixty-nine ninety-four, zero seven sixty-nine.

Tech: Alright, let me check your main Fusion number. I'll also set up another phone as an additional line to your product.

Customer: Okay, and now I want to add a few more lines. How many lines can I add?

Tech: You can add three more lines. You already have one, so you can add three more.

Customer: Alright, and how much am I paying monthly for this?

Tech: Currently, you have a contract for 25 euros including VAT, which includes unlimited calls, 2 gigabytes of data, free messages, and the Fusion product. Let me check the fixed-line details to see if you have fiber optics and what you've contracted. I'll provide you with the information shortly.

Customer: Okay, sounds good.

Tech: Alright, you have the Fusion package with football, which is 112 euros and 89 cents.

Customer: Yes, so I'm already paying for the Fusion contract.

Tech: Correct. The fixed line, TV, and mobile are included in that price. It offers 80 Imageio channels, a football package, and Canal Plus. In addition to that, there's the 25 euros for the line. I'm not sure if you're interested, but if you want to add fiber optics, we're currently offering free installation and a specialized technician who will upgrade your wiring to receive 100% of the promised megabits. Would you like more information on that?

Customer: Yes, but it won't cost me anything extra, right?

Tech: Well, adding fiber optics comes with an increase of 12 euros per month. This would make your total 122 euros per month, along with the added speed benefits of having a connection 10 times faster than ADSL.

Customer: So, 122 euros plus the 25 euros for the additional line, and if I want to add two more lines, it's another 25 euros each, right? What's the cheapest plan?

Tech: There's another plan that costs 12 euros, but it depends on your calling habits. It includes 1 gigabyte of data and free minutes per call, but there's a 15-cent connection fee for each call.

Customer: Well, the fiber optics sounds reasonable...

Tech: Fiber optics provides a significant speed boost—10 times faster. For instance, if you're often using the internet at home, this upgrade can make a noticeable difference. We also replace all the wiring, offering improved stability. Plus, right now, the installation fee is waived.

Customer: Alright, so you're saying I can get the fiber optics now, and we can talk about the phones later?

Tech: Of course, we can certainly do that.

Customer: Yes, but for now, I only want the fiber optics.

Tech: Understood. We will proceed with the installation of fiber optics. Let's start by recording the details for the fiber optics contract, shall we?

Customer: Sounds better.

Tech: Great. To begin, could you please provide me with your full name?

Customer: It's Andrés. Well, how...

Tech: Are you over 18 years old?

Customer: Yes.

Tech: Could you please provide me with the account number?

Customer: Sure, it's nine nine nine, two two nine nine nine nine.

Tech: Do you agree to migrate your current ADSL connection to a 100 megabyte fiber optic connection?

Customer: Yes.

Tech: We will proceed with the installation of the fiber optic connection, and there won't be any additional charges. However, this comes with a 12-month contract. If you were to cancel within the first 12 months, there would be a proportional penalty based on the time remaining. If you relocate to a new address within coverage, we can transfer the service for free, but it would reset the 12-month period. Are you okay with these terms?

Customer: Yes.

Tech: Do you agree to the changes regarding the fiber optic connection?

Customer: Yes.

Tech: This will also affect the cost. You currently have 80 Imageio channels and football, which adds up to 99 euros with VAT. Additionally, there's the signal maintenance fee of 10.40 euros. Are you okay with these changes?

Customer: Yes.

Tech: Do you consent to the charges being debited from your bank account for this contract?

Customer: Yes.

Tech: We have completed the procedure. The fiber optic technician will call you at the number you provided earlier, three four three, sixty-nine ninety-four, zero seven sixty-nine, to arrange the installation. Any more questions?

Customer: No, thank you very much for your help.

Tech: You will receive a call from us soon to evaluate your experience. Goodbye for now.

Customer: Alright, goodbye.
