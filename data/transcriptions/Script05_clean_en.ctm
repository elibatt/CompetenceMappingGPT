Tech: In Movistar, good morning, this is Luis speaking from Zaragoza. How can I assist you?

Customer: Good morning. I would like to know the cost of having a fixed home phone and internet.

Tech: The inquiry would be for what day, please?

Customer: For 3, 4, 5, 6, 5, 8, 9, 5, 3, 6, 9.

Tech: Do you currently have a service with us, or do you not have any service with us yet?

Customer: No, I don't have any service.

Tech: Alright, let me ask, do you use your mobile phone a lot or a little?

Customer: I use it normally.

Tech: Well, the most economical service for you would be a service called "Fusión." There are two options depending on your mobile usage. If you use the mobile phone a lot, it would cost €75 per month, and this includes a landline phone with free and unlimited calls from landline to landline and 500 minutes for landline to mobile calls on weekends. You also get a selection of TV channels, including series, movies, documentaries, and more. With the mobile phone, you get unlimited calls and messages and 2 GB of internet. All these services, including VAT, would be €65. 

Now, if you choose the €47 option with VAT included, you would have the landline phone with free and unlimited calls from landline to landline, coverage of 1000+ channels, and a landline phone. You would also get 100 minutes of calls and 500 MB of internet on the mobile phone. Please note that in this Fusión package, the installation of a decoder at your home is not included.

Customer: I'm not interested in the television service.

Tech: If you're interested, it would be €47 with VAT, and you would have the three services: landline, ADSL, and mobile phone.

Customer: And it's €47 with VAT?

Tech: Yes, €47 with VAT.

Customer: What if I want to add more lines?

Tech: If you want to add more lines, you can pay for additional lines. In this Fusión package with unlimited calls and 2 GB of internet, each additional line would cost €25 per month with VAT. Alternatively, we have other options like "Vive Doce," which has a monthly fee of €12 and includes 1 GB of internet with flat-rate calls, meaning no additional charges once the data is used up, and calls at €0.20 each, only charging the call setup fee if the call lasts more than 2 hours. But I don't think you'll be talking for that long. For example, if you make ten calls a month, it would be €12 for the monthly fee plus €12 for the calls, totaling €14.

Customer: Alright, thank you very much. I just wanted to know this.

Tech: Alright, if you decide to use our service, you're welcome.

Customer: No, thank you.

Tech: Thank you for your call. Goodbye.

Customer: Goodbye.

Tech: Goodbye. Thank you.
