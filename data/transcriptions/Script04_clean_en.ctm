Tech: Good morning, this is Sandra speaking from La Coruña. How can I assist you?

Customer: Good morning. I've been facing an issue for the past two months. My phone bill keeps increasing. I have the Fusion plan, and they told me there was a 6 to 7 euro increase. Last month, I visited the store and they said I had made some calls that caused the increase. My daughter might have made some calls or used something.

Tech: Let's take a look. Could you please provide me with the phone number associated with the query?

Customer: Sure, it's three four two, six nine seven five seven five one one.

Tech: Great, could you confirm the full name of the account holder, please?

Customer: Yolanda Díaz-Verdes.

Tech: And your account PIN?

Customer: Nine nine nine two one nine nine nine u.

Tech: I'm accessing your account data. Please hold on for a moment. I'm checking your bill. This month, you were billed sixty-three euros and sixteen cents, including VAT. The charge includes the Fusion fee and the mobile fee that you have financed.

Customer: Yes.

Tech: Additionally, there's a charge of four euros and ninety-two cents plus VAT for something included in the Movistar Plan Ver Realizar service. You've had this subscription since November 1st, and every update or notification from this content incurs a cost of seventy-four cents plus VAT, which is what's being charged.

Customer: That could be an antivirus.

Tech: I'm not sure at the moment. Well, ma'am...

Customer: It's a game.

Tech: Yes.

Customer: Alright. Can I unsubscribe? Can you unsubscribe me?

Tech: Yes, I will.

Customer: Yes, please.

Tech: Okay, please wait a moment while I process the cancellation. While waiting for the confirmation, let me check your current services. You have the Fusion package, and the additional lines list appears to be empty. Did you know you can include up to four additional numbers with unlimited calls, two gigabytes of high-speed data, and free text messages? Do you have any lines with other providers?

Customer: No, my husband is with Movistar as well.

Tech: Understood.

Customer: How much would an additional line cost within the Movistar Fusion package?

Tech: If you include it within the Movistar Fusion package, the monthly fee with VAT is twenty-five euros.

Customer: Okay, got it.

Tech: The cancellation has been processed.

Customer: Can you tell me which game this was?

Tech: I'm sorry, I don't have that information.

Customer: Alright, I understand. But they must have sent me a message or something about it.

Tech: Yes, it's possible.

Customer: And one more thing, how many megabits do I have with my Fusion plan?

Tech: Regarding your phone number...

Customer: Yes.

Tech: Well, <garbage> you have two gigabytes. Let me check the speed you have with us. One moment.

Customer: Okay.

Tech: You have one megabit.

Customer: Is this what I contracted with Fusion, or is it based on the area?

Tech: Yes, based on the area. Your area has a copper connection, which allows for ADSL speeds of up to ten megabits. Depending on the line installation and the coverage in your area, we can guarantee a connection of up to one megabit.

Customer: Even though I contracted for more?

Tech: Yes.

Customer: So, I'll have to wait for fiber to be installed, right?

Tech: I found that your area is in the process. In a few days...

Customer: Thank you very much.

Tech: In a few minutes, you'll receive a call to rate my assistance. Thank you very much.

Customer: Alright, have a good day.

Tech: You too.

Customer: Goodbye.
