Tech: Good morning, this is Asunta speaking from Toledo. How can I assist you today?

Customer: Uh, good morning. Well, I need you to send me a letter informing about a price change.

Tech: Of course.

Customer: So, starting from now, instead of sixty, it's less than seventy-five. Zero, yes, it's fifty plus taxes. I told you it would start from the fifth of January. Well, it's seventy-five now.

Tech: Yes, that's correct. It shows as fifty. Okay, the increase is clear. Is there anything else?

Customer: How much is it?

Tech: It's five euros, it's set at five euros.

Customer: It shows fifteen to me.

Tech: Yes, I understand, but it's five.

Customer: Well, let's see. You said fifteen. Right now, with the current plan, I'm looking at fifty euros per month. So, yes, they are not the same.

Tech: Let me check. Can you please provide me with your landline phone number?

Customer: <garbage> Three four nine one five seven seven ten fifty.

Tech: And the last six digits, please?

Customer: Fifty-six. You can use "Andr√©s" as the name.

Tech: Thank you. Just a moment, please. Don't hang up. Thanks for waiting. <garbage> I'm still on hold. <garbage> I'm connected to your line now, okay?

Customer: Yes, yes.

Tech: Just a moment. Okay, now I've got your line. The tariff you have is for sixty euros, including VAT, not fifty, sir.

Customer: Oh, Angela. See, it's five six. Of course, it includes VAT.

Tech: Yes, so the increase is just five euros.

Customer: Okay, okay. But is it for the same thing, or are they removing some service?

Tech: No, we're not removing or adding any services. It's for the same thing you have.

Customer: Okay, okay, well, then that's fine. Thank you.

Tech: Do you have any other questions?

Customer: No, no. I'll call you if I need anything.

Tech: Alright, and when you hang up, you'll receive a call to rate my service. Please stay on the line. Have a good day.

Customer: Okay, ten. Thanks.

Tech: Alright, goodbye. Have a nice day.

Customer: Goodbye.
