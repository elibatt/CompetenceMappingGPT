Customer: Hi, I wanted to set up a direct debit for my bill, please. Lately, I've had to pay manually because I haven't been receiving them.

Tech: Alright, very well. Please let me know whether you want to set up the direct debit for your landline or your mobile.

Customer: For the mobile.

Tech: Could you provide me with the phone number for which you'd like to set up the direct debit?

Customer: Yes, it's +34 198 414 083.

Tech: Great. Could you also provide me with the full name of the account holder, please?

Customer: Sure, my name is Asunta Medio, and the account holder's name is Eni, with the number 999 119 999.

Tech: Perfect. In order to set up the direct debit, I'll need to record a brief authorization from you to allow us to debit your bank account. When I ask, please provide me with the information again. Is that okay?

Customer: Okay, sure.

Tech: Please wait a moment. The recording is ready. For your security, we'll proceed with recording the account change request. I'll be asking you a few questions, and I appreciate your responses.
